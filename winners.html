                                vital to the people of Puerto Rico and in the US. As CUNY Chancellor Félix V.

                                (CPI) proved the value of that work this summer when it
                                obtained, exposed and explained a trove of hurtful comments
                                made by officials at the highest echelons of power on the
                                island. The reports sparked a widespread outcry that resonated 
                                across the globe and provoked swift change. I am pleased to
                                acknowledge the critical contributions of the CPI to my homeland

                            change is a more alarming story. Even as human populations

                            of the Chamber of Commerce, corporations and the US government.

                            <p>A provocative and compelling piece, Manhattan Gulag exposes 
                                extreme conditions at the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
                                (MCC), a pre-trial solitary confinement facility plagued by 
                                civil and human rights abuses and violations. These include 
                                filthy conditions, vermin infestations, substandard medical care, 
                                and violence and abuse at the hands of guards. The reporter spent 
                                18 months investigating life inside MCC’s cells of 17 feet by 8 feet, 
                                with no natural light and isolation so extreme that inmates are 
                                punished for speaking through the walls. But while the detention 
                                center sits just blocks from City Hall and Wall Street, only few 
                                people knew that a gulag exists right in the heart of Lower Manhattan.

                                <p>This outstanding investigation reveals how federal agents at US airports, 
                                    border crossings and immigration detention centers used vaginal probing, 
                                    shackling, handcuffing, and hours-long interrogations as federal officers 
                                    scrutinized people in search of hidden drugs.  In a profound and direct 
                                    style of reporting, Ferriss uncovered and documented 11 invasive-search 
                                    legal claims, and her reporting revealed that six had resulted in

                                        students and experts. The parents’ stories about their children were compelling,

                                            poverty line; nearly 4,000 of its men are or have been in prison. Andre Lee Ellis 
                                            has spent the last 5 years on this battlefield. His weapons are fruits and vegetables, 
                                            mentorship and love. “We Got This” is a community garden where 58 year-old Mr. 
                                            Ellis mentors endangered black boys, ages 12 to 17. This is also where the reporter 
                                            grew up and, in journal entries, he reflects on reporting from a place he once

                                                learn how they came to be who they are and where they are. This feature story required 
                                                tremendous reporting diligence to both navigate prison bureaucracies and win the trust 
                                                of the prisoners themselves and get them to open up about their lives. At a time when 
                                                efforts are growing to scale back or abolish entirely the U.S. system of mass 
                                                incarceration, Melamed helps us better understand how that system continues from one 
                                                generation to the next.

                                                    is the 2019 recipient of the Cartooning with a Conscience Award for the range of 
                                                    his work, unique artistry, and poignant social justice commentary. After 25 
                                                    years as the award-winning editorial cartoonist for the <em>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,</em> 
                                                    Rob Rogers was fired in June of 2018 for drawing cartoons critical of President 
                                                    Trump. Rather than bow to pressure from management to soften his criticism of 
                                                    Trump, Rogers risked his livelihood to maintain his integrity.

                        Herb Boyd is a recognized journalist, historian, activist, and author of 23 books. 
                        His award-winning books give profound meaning to the Black experience in American life, 
                        from <em>We Shall Overcome: A History of the Civil Rights Movement, Black Panthers for Beginners</em>to 
                        biographies of James Baldwin, Sugar Ray Robinson and others.  This year his profile has 
                        catapulted even further with the release of his latest book, <em>Black Detroit: A People’s 
                        History of Self Determination</em>. Part memoir, part love letter, part historical chronicle, 
                        Boyd shares his reflections on this iconic American city and explains in detail the significant 
                        contributions African Americans have made to Detroit and Detroit to the nation.

                    A riveting series about the duplicity of American companies like Case Farms in Ohio

                    brutal, U.S. supported military dictatorship and its aftershocks, and their flight to the 
                    north to escape violence, only to find themselves subjected to inhumane conditions, 
                    exploitation and injuries.

                <p class="text-reg">
                    <strong>Why we did this story:</strong><br>
                    For years, we’d been hearing about how companies use immigration status to get rid of 
                    undocumented workers when they get injured, fight for stolen wages or try to form a union. 
                    We wanted to show how this works beyond just allegations against fly-by-night contractors, 
                    how it becomes a way of doing business and how federal and state laws actually encourage it. 
                    In doing some initial reporting, Michael heard many tips about a chicken company that had long 
                    recruited Guatemalan immigrants and had stifled several attempts by workers pushing for better 
                    conditions. He also got some key documents related to a story he and Howard had started looking 
                    into two years earlier as part of a project on workers’ comp. Together, they obtained data from 
                    Florida and tracked down documents from more than 1,000 court cases, showing how insurance companies 
                    were using a state law to get injured immigrant workers arrested, and in some cases deported.

                    <strong>Why I wrote the story:</strong><br>
                    School segregation has received renewed interest among education reporters, but the coverage 
                    has not examined the role of the federal government in allowing the re- segregation of American 
                    schools. At the time we began our investigation in 2016, the Obama administration had revived an 
                    old desegregation case in Cleveland, Mississippi. We wondered whether the Justice Department and 
                    courts had been just as active elsewhere. After a year of data analysis and reporting, we learned 
                    the opposite was true. In many cases, the federal government under several presidential administrations 
                    had stood by as districts flouted their legal obligations and allowed segregated schools to flourish.

                    It’s no secret that the fabric of New York is changing fast. In Brooklyn in particular, 
                    soaring real estate prices, new shops and new people have fired up heated debates about 
                    gentrification. Yet the step-by-step process of how neighborhoods change is often invisible. 
                    We wanted to better understand how it worked–as reporters, but also as two white residents of 
                    Brooklyn who are part of that shift. We began by taking a close look at a group of Brooklyn 
                    houses that had shot up in value in less than a year. We found a pattern that surprised us: 
                    nearly all of the properties had recently been owned by residents of color on the verge of 
                    foreclosure. As we dove into court documents and property records, we realized that a story 
                    we had thought of as uniquely of the moment was in fact just the latest chapter in a largely 
                    overlooked history of race and homeownership that has been unfolding in this city, and this 
                    country, for decades.

                    <strong>Why we wrote this story:</strong><br>
                    Many people think about health as a consequence of individual choices—what you eat, how much 
                    exercise you get, whether you smoke or drink. But when it comes to infant and maternal mortality 
                    rates in the United States, individual actions don’t explain the persistence of a wide racial gap. 
                    We wanted to understand why black women and babies are so much more likely to die in the United 
                    States than their white counterparts. Ultimately our aim was to illuminate the growing body of 
                    research pointing to stress and racism, rather than race itself, as a defining factor.
                </p> 

                <p class="text-reg">
                    As a reproductive health reporter, McClain knew the bleak maternal health statistics. But it 
                    took being pregnant herself to drive home the risks black women face in trying to safely bring 
                    their children into the world. Her own efforts to navigate health challenges and find culturally 
                    competent birth support became an useful narrative device to show how chronic stress and implicit 
                    bias on the part of health professionals can lead to poor health outcomes for black women and 
                    infants. For Carpenter, Milwaukee—one of the most segregated cities in America—presented a 
                    striking example of the impact of institutional racism on infant mortality rates, and of how 
                    difficult it is for elected officials and advocates to reverse the trend.

                    <p class="text-reg">
                        <strong>Why I wrote the story:</strong><br>
                        I wrote this series because I was stunned to learn that, as children with intellectual and 
                        developmental adults age into adulthood and well beyond, they become almost invisible to the 
                        greater population. I learned this after writing about a severely intellectually disabled adult 
                        named Christina, whose death by neglect from her state-paid caretaker, was utterly ignored by 
                        local law and social-services agencies.  After my story about Christina was published (it was 
                        called “The Death No One Cares About”), countless parents reached out to share their own horror 
                        stories about caregiver abuse and agency incompetence. About political and public indifference to 
                        the needs of intellectually disabled adults. And about the lack of compassion and resources for 
                        elderly parents who have become too old and frail to care for their aging, impaired children.
                    </p> 
    
                    <p class="text-reg">
                        I felt compelled to tell the stories of these invisible men and women and their families. 
                        The result is “Falling Off the Cliff,” a four-part series that looks at what happens to profoundly 
                        disabled children as they grow into adulthood – and how their aging families fret over what will 
                        happen to these always vulnerable children once they themselves are gone.

                        <strong>Why this film:</strong><br>
                        Uber, and others apps like it, are often hailed as great disrupters, which have drastically 
                        altered established industries. However, these disruptions come at a cost. Although they are 
                        convenient and often cheaper, someone is paying the price. I thought it was important to look 
                        at these popular new technologies from the employees perspective. Uber is just one example of 
                        a general trend toward freelance work, where employees don’t get benefits and have little security. 
                        Companies are taking advantage of a loophole in the law and my intention in making this film 
                        was to shed light on that. I made this film because I know of many people across industries, 
                        including myself, who are dealing with this problem.

                        the <em>East Valley Tribune</em> in Mesa, Ariz., he and colleague Paul Giblin won a 
                        Pulitzer Prize for stories that exposed how immigration enforcement by the 
                        Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office undermined investigations and emergency response.

                        <strong>Topher Sanders</strong>
                        covers racial inequality for ProPublica. Prior to joining ProPublica in 2015, 
                        he reported on education, city government and criminal justice for <em>The Florida Times-Union</em>. 
                        His data-driven reporting on juvenile plea deals and the time Jacksonville juveniles 
                        spend in pre-trial detention facilities was a finalist for an Investigative Reporters 
                        and Editors award in 2015. His reporting on questionable behavior by Jacksonville’s 
                        elected public defender prompted Florida Gov. Rick Scott to order an investigation of 
                        the office in 2013.

                <p class="text-reg">
                    <strong>Why we did this project:</strong><br>
                    The reporting began as a search for stories that would illuminate the plea deals that dominate 
                    our criminal justice system, to explore what role evidence plays in the courts when more than 
                    90 percent of convictions come by guilty plea. We were checking the National Registry of 
                    Exonerations regularly, which includes very few plea deal cases. But suddenly, by mid-2015, 
                    that was changing. Dozens of overturned drug convictions out of Texas joined the database. 
                    Reading through the case summaries, it seemed to us the unifying characteristic was inaccurate 
                    police field tests. Again and again, innocent people pleaded guilty with only the officers’ 
                    results as evidence identifying illegal drugs.

                    <strong>Why I did this project:</strong><br>
                    I came across a lawsuit that mentioned that the city tried to evict a woman from her home 
                    based on criminal charges that were dismissed because the lab test came back negative for 
                    narcotics. I was shocked that an entire family could be rendered temporarily homeless, and 
                    a son banned from his mother’s home for life, over such flimsy allegations. I wanted to 
                    see if this was systemic or an anomaly.

                    I was gathering data for a story on the Crow Reservation’s water quality and realized their 
                    fight for clean water all too common and that tribes across the country are locked in struggle 
                    to protect their water, their environment, and their future. Dwindling or contaminated water 
                    not only sickens tribes but also taints traditions and squeezes spiritual connections to a 
                    breaking point. These are stories of environmental injustice and they needed to be told.

                    <strong>About The Texas Tribune:</strong><br>
                    The Texas Tribune is the only member-supported, digital-first, nonpartisan media organization 
                    that informs Texans — and engages with them — about public policy, politics, government and 
                    statewide issues. The Texas Tribune and its destination website were launched in November 2009,
                    thanks to $4 million in private contributions as seed funding, a small band of talented computer 
                    programmers and some of the most accomplished journalists in the state. Now with a staff of 
                    nearly 50 dedicated reporters, editors, technologists, designers and business leaders, the 
                    Tribune has continued to advance its mission of bringing greater transparency and accountability 
                    to public policy, politics and government through news, data and events.

                    <strong>Why we did this project:</strong><br>
                    From the time Donald Trump announced his run for the White House until the brash billionaire 
                    prepared to take the oath of office late last year, a team of reporters at The Texas Tribune 
                    went deep on the issues that would fuel his rise more than any other: border security and 
                    immigration. Over the course of the yearlong project, the Tribune traveled to violence-torn 
                    Central America, to the most heavily crossed patch of the U.S.-Mexico border, and to the 
                    U.S. worksites where so many immigrants find low-paying jobs and exploitation. All our 
                    stories had something in common: They were about people caught up in a giant international 
                    smuggling ecosystem that’s being constantly nourished by the insatiable U.S. demand for 
                    illegal drugs and undocumented laborers.

                    <strong>Receiving the award on behalf of the 50 reporters involved in this series:</strong><br>
                    <strong>Jay Root</strong>
                    is a native of Liberty. He never knew any reporters growing up and has never taken a journalism 
                    class in his life. But somehow he got hooked on the news business. It all started when Root 
                    walked into the offices of <em>The Daily Texan</em>, his college newspaper, during his last year at 
                    the University of Texas in 1987. He couldn’t resist the draw: it was the biggest collection of 
                    misfits ever assembled. After graduating, he took a job at a Houston chemical company and soon 
                    realized it wasn’t for him. Root applied for an unpaid internship at the Houston Post in 1990, 
                    and it turned into a full-time job that same year. He has been a reporter ever since. Root has 
                    covered natural disasters, live music and Texas politics — not necessarily in that order. He 
                    was Austin bureau chief of the <em>Fort Worth Star-Telegram</em> for a dozen years, most of them good. 
                    He also covered politics and the Legislature for The Associated Press before joining the staff 
                    of the Tribune. Root is the author of <em>Oops! A Diary From The 2012 Campaign Trail</em>, an insider’s 
                    account of Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s dramatic collapse in the 2012 presidential race.

                        <strong>Why we did this project:</strong><br>
                        Nancy Cambria and Laurie Skrivan were among more than two dozen reporters and photographers at the
                        <em>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</em> sent to cover the continuing protests and unrest in the aftermath of 
                         the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by a Ferguson Police officer. Cambria, the newspaper’s 
                         children and families reporter, was struck by the number of toddlers and young children she saw 
                         on the often volatile protest lines. Skrivan was interested in documenting the daily lives of 
                         families living within yards of the protests and a highly militarized police presence. Cambria 
                         decided to explore the issue of trauma and toxic stress more deeply in the community after she 
                         had discussions with therapists at a nearby Red Cross emergency drop-in center. They told her 
                         residents weren’t just traumatized by Brown’s death and the ensuing unrest. They were also 
                         re-living past trauma from growing up and living in impoverished, often violent neighborhoods.
                    </p> 
    
                    <p class="text-reg">
                        With the help of a National Center for Health Journalism fellowship, Cambria learned about brain 
                        development and “toxic stress” and its relationship to poverty and poor adult health outcomes. 
                        Not long after Skrivan and Cambria formally began their reporting in the neighborhood for the 
                        project, Jamyla Bolden, 8, was fatally shot through a window while doing her homework. Jamyla 
                        lived just blocks away from where Brown was killed a year earlier. Cambria and Skrivan followed 
                        children and families who knew Jamyla for seven months to create their special report.

                    on the diverse activists who pushed forward their demands for a more inclusive community reinforced why I 
                    chose to enter this field in the first place.

                        I remember learning about politics from editorial cartoons when they helped me puzzle out what 
                        Nixon was up to and what Watergate was all about. They were my Rosetta Stone to the world of 
                        politics. I can easily imagine some girl or boy today furrowing their forehead over a cartoon 
                        done by me, or by one of my colleagues. I can also see a light suddenly going on and the gift 
                        that was given to me is passed to another generation.

                            THREE TOURS, produced and directed by Betty Yu, is a documentary that captures the lives of 
                            three U.S. military veterans, Nicole Goodwin, Ramon Mejia and Ryan Holleran, as they work to 
                            heal their wounds and battle with PTSD resulting from their deployments in Iraq. The film follows
                             their transformation from U.S. military trained soldiers to agents of change advocating for 
                             proper mental health treatment of veterans and an end to unjust wars.

                            Betty Yu graduated from the IMA MFA Hunter College program in 2016. She is a Chinese-American 
                            interdisciplinary, multi-media artist, educator and community activist. Her documentary and 
                            multi-media work is shaped and influenced by her direct experience as a daughter raised by 
                            garment worker parents who toiled in sweatshops after arriving from Hong Kong over 37 years ago. 
                            This upbringing undoubtedly frames who she is as an artist today. In her artwork she approaches 
                            social issues through personal story, family narrative and community history. Her work explores 
                            issues ranging from labor rights, immigrant justice, and gender equity to militarism.

                    USA Today pulled out all the stops to examine the myriad ways in which failing to treat the 
                    mentally ill leads to systemic problems that affect American society as a whole. A 
                    joint-effort by multiple reporters, the series considers such wide-ranging topics as suicide, 
                    mass shootings, homelessness, and substance abuse. Rather than merely exposing the problem, 
                    “The Cost of Not Caring” also addresses potential solutions. <br>

                    <strong>Nathan Fitch, </strong> <em>Mikros Soldier</em><br>
                    Micronesian Pacific Islanders are not US citizens, yet they enroll in the US military 
                    – and die – at disproportionately high rates. Mikros Soldier explores the complex relationship 
                    between the U.S. and Micronesia, and follows two young men as they leave their tranquil island 
                    homes, go through basic training, and head to Afghanistan.

                <p>
                    <strong>Gary Varvel</strong>, cartoonist of the Indianapolis Star, 
                    has been named 2010 winner of the Grambs Aronson Award for Cartooning With a Conscience.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Varvel’s ambitious project, “The Path to Hope,” impressed the judges for its sensitive registration
                     of the everyday burdens that weigh down the poor. Varvel’s artistic technique, combining 
                     photoshopped still images for backgrounds and pen and ink for characters, also won plaudits. 
                     Small touches lent realism and depth to cartooned faces.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Varvel registers the everyday hardships faced by the poor — illiteracy, transportation, 
                    lack of access to healthy food, domestic and neighborhood violence –with a level of 
                    empathetic detail rare even in print news accounts. Homing in on the inefficiently laid 
                    out Indianapolis bus system, Varvel writes, “Working the third shift can mean up to an 
                    hour-long commute late at night and back home early in the morning, hoping to arrive in 
                    time to get the children off to school.”

                    At the time the two-part series appeared, none of these attacks and killings had ever been 
                    investigated. Conducting dozens of interviews with survivors, historians, eyewitnesses, 
                    firefighters, forensic pathologists and self-described vigilantes and poring over more than 
                    800 autopsy reports, Thompson was able to document 11 shootings, including several possible 
                    murders. His reporting, supported by The Nation Institute’s Investigative Fund, ProPublica, 
                    the Center for Investigative Reporting and New American Media, resulted in two grand jury 
                    investigations and critical reforms in the New Orleans Police Department.

                    <strong>JoAnn Wypijewski</strong> for a career distinguished by <a href="http://www.harpers.org/archive/1998/07/0059622" style="color:#13559C;">original reporting</a>  
                    on the interweaving of social and sexual affairs. Through in-depth features for Harper’s, Mother Jones, Legal Affairs, Counterpunch and most recently in her column <a href="http://www.thenation.com/issue/july-20-2009" style="color:#13559C;">“Carnal Knowledge”</a> in <em>The Nation</em>,
                    Wypijewski shreds the clichés that structure typical media narratives and “common sense.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the late 1990s, she visited two towns projected into the national spotlight by sensational cases 
                    involving sex and managed to tell a more penetrating, nuanced story about them than 
                    had any other journalist.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    In Jamestown, New York, for instance, a 21-year-old black man named Nushawn Williams had been 
                    accused of having sex with dozens of teenaged girls — most of them white — and of infecting 13 
                    of them with HIV. The prevailing narrative demonized him as an HIV predator and sexual 
                    scorekeeper. For the story called, “The Secret Sharer” Wypijewski went to Jamestown. Without 
                    denying Williams’ agency, she asked herself what needs Williams had filled in the lives of the 
                    young women there. Her detailed account intimately reconstructed the constraints on life 
                    (and love) chances for women and men in a town suffering progressive deindustrialization.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Wypijewski accomplished similar exercises in extraordinary contextualization in pieces on the 
                    murder of 21-year-old <a href="http://www.harpers.org/archive/1999/09/0060647" style="color:#13559C;">Matthew Shepard</a>, 
                    who was beaten, stripped, and left to die tied to a fence outside Laramie, Wyoming and the conviction of Paul Shanley, 
                    a defrocked priest convicted of sexual abuse on the basis of “recovered memory.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    A piece on <a href="http://live.thenation.com/doc/20080331/wypijewski" style="color:#13559C;">Notes on a Scandal</a> 
                    the New York Governor Elliot Spitzer challenges conventional wisdom by suggesting that he and his 
                    wife may actually have had the happy marriage they claimed they did and that the infamous 
                    prostitute, “Kristen,” may have played an important role in maintaining it. Articulating a moral 
                    realism and nuance that journalistic discourse rarely permits itself, she writes, “sometimes you 
                    don’t get from your husband or wife everything that you need. . . . That [Spitzer] himself had 
                    scant generosity toward others who are drawn to the forbidden, need not compel us all to be 
                    prosecutors.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    Wypijewski’s ability to see beyond individual “choice,” narrow good and evil and typical 
                    “root causes,” enriches the very conception of social justice journalism.

                    <em>Mother Jones Magazine</em> for comprehensive, vivid coverage of climate change in <a href="http://motherjones.com/environment/2009/11/editors-note" style="color:#13559C;">The Climate Countdown</a> 
                    a special of issue of <em>Mother Jones</em>, writers spanned the globe, weighing the present-day, 
                    human costs of the swiftly warming planet and analyzing obstacles to mitigation. Destinations 
                    included the Pacific island nation of Tuvalu, whose residents are the world’s first climate 
                    refugees; a slice of Brazilian rainforest being used by General Motors to offset its SUV-sized 
                    carbon footprint while forcing local people to find somewhere else to live; Alaskan backcountry 
                    being flooded by early thaws and California’s once-fertile Central Valley devolving into a 
                    21st-century Dust Bowl. Coverage of the Copenhagen climate talks was enriched through 
                    cooperative reporting with eight other journalism organizations so that Mother Jones was able 
                    to field a staff of two dozen reporters, columnists and videographers. The magazine’s special 
                    issue announces a significant ongoing commitment to expanded reporting on what is arguably the 
                    most far-reaching story of our era.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Nina Bernstein</strong> of <em>The New York Times</em> for <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/b/nina_bernstein/index.html" style="color:#13559C;">multi-faceted coverage of immigration issues</a>. 
                    Bernstein’s ongoing coverage of immigration issues for the New York Times paints a complex 
                    picture of people drawn to the American dream and the intricacies of public policy governing 
                    their movements. Through her reporting we witness a Burmese refugee’s first sight of snow and 
                    learn of a Senegalese boy, left from the age of 14 to fend for himself in New York. His lack 
                    of documents is only revealed when his skill in robotics helps to win his team an invitation 
                    to fly to a national contest in Atlanta.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At the same time, Bernstein, keeps a steady eye on the machinery of law-enforcement and due process.
                    Tracking the patchwork of more than 500 county jails, profit-making prisons and federal detention 
                    centers housing half a million noncitizens, she reports that all too often they fail to work as 
                    they should. As her stories unfold, we see secrecy and lack of legal accountability shielding 
                    operations from independent oversight. Immigrants have no right to court-appointed lawyers. No 
                    central body is mandated to publicly track deaths in custody, nor is any independent inquiry 
                    required into such tests. The mentally ill receive scant understanding of the difficulties they 
                    face. In short, Nina Bernstein’s thoroughgoing enterprise reporting brings the human and political 
                    dimensions of the immigration issue to life.

                <p>
                    <strong>Jen Sorensen: </strong><u>“Slowpoke Comics,”</u>
                    for political satire and popular culture commentary. The work of cartoonist and illustrator 
                    Jen Sorensen is noteworthy among alternative weekly graphic artists for branching in two 
                    directions. Like many cartoonists, Sorensen satirizes the contemporary political scene. She 
                    notes the ironies of Teabagger activists who despise big government but unquestioningly support 
                    the president as “unitary executive.” She gives us a character in minute-man hat fuming that 
                    there will be hell to pay if “the government usurps my right to crushing medical bills!” Turning
                    to the art of naming political programs (“Name That Plan!”), Sorensen points up a problem with 
                    the “public option”– it “sounds like a restroom.” Better to “go macho” with “TOUGHCARE”, 
                    promoted by a thug in camo pants and muscle shirt warning that “a strong America needs healthy
                    people!”
                </p>

                <p>
                    But Sorensen also expands the usual pattern by using her strips to parody popular, especially 
                    digital, culture. She depicts grandparents of the future, reminiscing to their grandchildren 
                    over their Wikipedia page editing battles and the candid videos they posted on YouTube. When 
                    the grandchildren criticize them for wasting their lives staring at screens, the elders simply 
                    abandon the “virtual front porch” (“with grandkids”) they had been viewing. In another strip, 
                    Sorensen envisions a time when nostalgic mobile telephone users carry phone booths on their 
                    backs so they can get that “soulful, landline feel” and folks slow life down with “TELEGRAM TWEETS” 
                    (e.g. a hand-delivered cable reading, “just captured urine sample from my dog STOP”).

                    <strong>Les Payne</strong> is a Pulitzer Prize-winning  journalist who worked for 28 
                    years at <em>Newsday</em> as a reporter, foreign correspondent, columnist and associate editor. In 1974, he shared a 
                    Pulitzer for his investigative work on the heroin trail from Turkey to the United States. A co-founder and 
                    former president of the National Association of Black Journalists, he was inducted into NABJ’s Hall of Fame 
                    in 2008. Murray Kempton once described Payne as “a great editor because he is always his own man.” Payne has 
                    trained generations of reporters to cover the basics and to dig deeper; his news staffs won every major award 
                    in journalism, including six Pulitzer Prizes. His mantra as reporter, editor and columnist has been — <u>“Don’t
